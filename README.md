gulpfile-laravel
================

Gulpjs file used with laravel

This is the gulpfile I use with my laravel projects.  For development I use `gulp dev` and for production (minified stuff) I use `gulp`.

`gulp dev` will watch the files as well as using livereload.

There are a bunch of notes in the gulpfile, so take a look at them.
